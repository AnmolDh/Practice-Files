            <h3>Unveiling the Darkness Within: Eren Yeager's Journey through Shadows and Sacrifice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unleashing chaos:</strong> Eren's transformation into a Titan triggered the destruction of the inner walls,
                    leading to
                    widespread panic and loss of life.</li>
                <li><strong>Titan massacres:</strong> As a Titan, Eren engaged in brutal battles, mercilessly slaughtering enemy Titans
                    and humans alike.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Manipulation and deceit:</strong> Eren employed cunning tactics, including misleading his friends and allies,
                    to achieve his
                    goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Declaration of war:</strong> Eren's radical ideology led him to declare war on the entire world, seeking the
                    complete
                    annihilation of his enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Sacrifices and collateral damage:</strong> Eren's actions resulted in the deaths of numerous innocent
                    civilians and even his
                    own comrades.</li>
                <li><strong>Embracing extremism:</strong> Eren's relentless pursuit of freedom drove him to adopt extreme measures,
                    blurring the line
                    between heroism and villainy.</li>
                <li><strong>Unleashing the Rumbling:</strong> Eren's plan involved activating the colossal Titans within the walls,
                    resulting in a
                    devastating onslaught that threatened to wipe out entire nations and civilizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Betrayal of trust:</strong> Eren's drastic shift in ideology caused him to betray the trust of his closest
                    friends, leaving
                    them emotionally shattered and questioning their own beliefs.</li>
                <li><strong>Manipulating memories:</strong> Eren utilized his powers as the Attack Titan to alter the memories of his
                    comrades,
                    distorting their perception of reality and leaving them traumatized.</li>
                <li><strong>Zealotry and fanaticism:</strong> Eren's unwavering conviction in his cause led him to adopt a fanatical
                    mindset, showing
                    little regard for the lives and well-being of those who stood in his way.</li>
                <li><strong>Embracing his dark side:</strong> As the story progressed, Eren's character evolved into a darker, morally
                    ambiguous figure,
                    embracing violence and chaos as means to an end.</li>
                <li><strong>Questionable morality:</strong> Eren's actions raised ethical dilemmas, blurring the line between heroism and
                    villainy, and
                    forcing viewers to question the justifiability of his extreme measures.</li>
            </ul>
