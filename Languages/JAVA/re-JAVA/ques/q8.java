// A company has to tag itâ€™s products. Each product has an associated product type which is used
// to tag the products. Product type is a sequence of lower-case letters from the English
// alphabet. The company wants to have an algorithm for their system which takes the product
// type and outputs the tag. To generate the tag, pairs of adjacent characters are formed from
// the start of the product type. From each pair, the lexicographically smallest character will be
// removed. If a character will be left unpaired then that character will be taken as it is in the tag.
